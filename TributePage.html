                        </h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>1936
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Habibie was born in Parepare, South Sulawesi Province of Dutch East Indies.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>1960
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Habibie received a degree in engineering in Germany, giving him the title Diplom-Ingenieur. He remained in Germany as a research assistant under Hans Ebner at the Lehrstuhl und Institut für Leichtbau, RWTH Aachen to conduct research for his doctoral degree.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>1962
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Habibie returned to Indonesia for three months on sick leave. During this time, he was reacquainted with Hasri Ainun, the daughter of R. Mohamad Besari. Habibie had known Hasri Ainun in childhood, junior high school and in senior high school at SMA Kristen Dago (Dago Christian Senior High School), Bandung. The two married on 12 May 1962, returning to Germany shortly afterwards.[4] Habibie and his wife settled in Aachen for a short period before moving to Oberforstbach.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>1963
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Habibie had a son, Ilham Akbar Habibie.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>1965
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Habibie delivered his thesis in aerospace engineering and received the grade of “very good” for his dissertation, giving him the title Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften. During the same year, he accepted Hans Ebner’s offer to continue his research on Thermoelastisitas and work toward his Habilitation, but he declined the offer to join RWTH as a professor per se. His thesis about light construction for supersonic or hypersonic states also attracted offers of employment from companies such as Boeing and Airbus, which Habibie again declined. </li>
                                    <li>Habibie did accept a position with Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm in Hamburg. There, he developed theories on thermodynamics, construction, and aerodynamics known as the Habibie Factor, Habibie Theorem, and Habibie Method, respectively. He worked for Messerschmit on the development of the Airbus A-300B aircraft.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                    <li>He was promoted to vice president of the company.</li>
                                    <li>Suharto recruited Habibie to return to Indonesia as part of Suharto’s drive to industrialize and develop the country. Habibie initially served as a special assistant to Ibnu Sutowo, the CEO of state oil company Pertamina.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Habibie was made Chief Executive Officer of the new state-owned enterprise Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN)</li>
                                    <li>In 1985, PT. Nurtanio changed its name to Indonesian Aviation Industry and is now known as Indonesian Aerospace (Dirgantara)</li>

                                    <li>He was appointed as Minister of Research and Technology. He continued to play an important role in IPTN other “strategic” industries in this post. </li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>IPTN had grown considerably, specializing in the manufacture of helicopters and small passenger planes </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>1991
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Habibie oversaw ten state-owned industries including ship- and train-building, steel, arms, communications, and energy.[7] </li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Habibie becomes member of Golkar at 1993 to 1999 </li>
                                    <li>A 1993 estimate determined that the estimates used nearly $2 billion a year in state funding, although the government’s opaque accounting practices meant that the size of the industries was not completely known.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>In developing Indonesia’s aviation industry, he adopted an approach called “Begin at the End and End at the Beginning”.[9] In this method, elements such as basic research became the last things upon which to focus, whilst actual manufacturing of the planes was placed as the first objective. Under Habibie’s leadership, IPTN became a manufacturer of aircraft including Puma helicopters and CASA planes. It pioneered a small passenger airplane, the N-250 Gatokaca, in 1995, but the project was a commercial failure.</li>

                                    <li>In September 2006, he released a book called <em>Detik-Detik Yang Menentukan : Jalan Panjang Indonesia Menuju Demokrasi (Decisive Moments: Indonesia’s Long Road Towards Democracy)</em>. The book recalled the events of May 1998 which led to his rise to the Presidency. In the book, he controversially accuses Lieutenant General Prabowo Subianto, Suharto’s son-in-law (at that time) and the Kostrad Commander, of planning a coup d’état against him in May 1998.- </li>

                                    <li>After his wife’s death, Habibie published a book titled <strong>"Habibie &amp; Ainun"</strong> which recounts his relationship with Hasri Ainun from their courtship until her death. The book has been adapted into a film of the same name which was released on December 20, 2012</li>
